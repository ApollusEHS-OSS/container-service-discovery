= Service Discovery for Amazon ECS

This repo has a simple example that shows service discovery for Amazon EC2 Container Service.

== Build Services

This is an optional step as images are already available in Docker Hub.

```
docker-compose build
```

== Run Services

```
docker-compose up -d
```

== Access service using web application

. Using CLI: `curl localhost:49160; curl localhost:49161`
. Using Node web application:
+
```
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```
+
. Access the following URLs:
+
```
http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:8080?greet=ho
http://localhost:8080?id=1
http://localhost:8080?greet=ho&id=1
```
