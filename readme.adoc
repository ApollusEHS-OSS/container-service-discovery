= Service Discovery in Containers on AWS

This repo has a simple example that shows service discovery for different container orchestration frameworks.

The sample application uses three services:

image::images/services.png[]

. `webapp`: Web application microservice uses `greeter` and `name` microservice to generate a greeting for a person.
. `greeter`: A microservice returns a greeting based upon `greet` name/value keypair in the URL.
. `name`: A microservice that returns person's name based upon `id` name/value keypair in the URL.

These services are built as Docker image and deployed in Docker, Amazon ECS, Kubernetes and DC/OS.

All services are built as Node.js application. `webapp` service need to be configured using the following parameters:

. `NAME_SERVICE_HOST`
. `NAME_SERVICE_PORT`
. `NAME_SERVICE_PATH`
. `GREETER_SERVICE_HOST`
. `GREETER_SERVICE_PORT`
. `GREETER_SERVICE_PATH`

== Build services

Build Docker images for different services:

```
docker-compose build
```

== Setup cluster and deploy application

. link:docker.adoc[Docker]
. link:ecs.adoc[Amazon ECS]
. link:k8s.adoc[Kubernetes]
. link:dcos.adoc[DC/OS]

== Access application

Access the following URLs using `curl` or in browser:

```
http://<host>:<port>
http://<host>:<port>0?greet=ho
http://<host>:<port>?id=1
http://<host>:<port>?greet=ho&id=1
```
