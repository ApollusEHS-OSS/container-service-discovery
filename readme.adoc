= Service Discovery in Container Orchestration Frameworks

This repo has a simple example that shows service discovery for different container orchestration frameworks.

== Build services

This is an optional step as images are already available in Docker Hub.

```
docker-compose build
```

== Run services (needs debugging)

```
docker stack up --compose-file=docker-compose.yml webapp
```

== Access service using web application (needs debugging)

Access the following URLs:

```
http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:8080?greet=ho
http://localhost:8080?id=1
http://localhost:8080?greet=ho&id=1
```

== Delete services

```
docker stack rm webapp
```
