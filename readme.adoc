= Service Discovery for Amazon ECS

This repo has a simple example that shows service discovery for Amazon EC2 Container Service.

== Build Docker Images for Services

This is an optional step as images are already available in Docker Hub.

```
docker-compose build
```

== Run Docker Container for Services

```
docker-compose up -d
```

== Access service using web application

. Using CLI: `curl localhost:49160; curl localhost:49161`
. Using Node web application:
+
```
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```
+
Access http://localhost:8080 in the browser
